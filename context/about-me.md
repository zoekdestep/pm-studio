## How I Work

### PM Philosophy

[What do you believe about how PM work should be done? What matters most to you?]

> *Example: Ship fast, learn fast. I believe in running lots of small experiments rather than big bets. Data informs decisions but doesn't replace intuition - sometimes the best features don't test well initially but become beloved over time.*

### Decision-Making Style

[How do you balance data vs. intuition? How do you think about speed vs. quality?]

> *Example:*
> - *Experiments + intuition: We run A/B tests on everything, but I trust my gut when data is inconclusive*
> - *Speed matters: I'd rather ship 80% and iterate than wait for perfect*
> - *Strong opinions, loosely held: I'll advocate hard but change my mind with new evidence*

### Communication Preferences

[Document style preferences, how you like to receive feedback, meeting vs. async preferences]

> *Example:*
> - *I prefer structured docs over slide decks*
> - *Give me direct feedback - don't sugarcoat*
> - *Async-first, meetings for alignment and decisions*
